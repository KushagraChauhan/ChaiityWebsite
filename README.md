The website should have the following functionalities:
-	Registration of the user, NGO and government entity
-	Each user will have their own username, password, and account private key, which will authenticate them and grant them access to their own dashboard.
-	The dashboard will allow the donor to donate, track transactions, total contribution of the donor.
-	The tracking will allow the donor to see the most up-to-date status of a transaction.
-	The government body would have the authority to approve the NGO's demands. They'll be able to keep track of the transactions as well.
